# To-Do-List

This is a beginner-friendly To-Do List application written in Python that runs in the terminal. It allows users to add, view, and remove tasks. All tasks are saved in a file (`tasks.txt`) so they are retained between runs.

- View your saved tasks
- Add a new task
- Remove a task by number
- Automatically saves tasks to a file

- The app uses a menu-based Command-Line Interface (CLI).
- File operations are handled using `open()` and `os.path.exists()`.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the folder where `todo.py` is saved.
